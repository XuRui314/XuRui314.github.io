I am currently an associate professor at School of Information Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). Before that, I worked as a PostDoc in [Prof. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io)'s group. I received my PhD degree from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Shuqiang Jiang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/homepage/jsqgrzy/), and my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2016. I also had close collaboration with [Prof. Rui Shao](https://rshaojimmy.github.io/OrionLab/index.html), [Prof. Miao Zhang](https://miaozhang0525.github.io/), and [Prof. Xinhang Song](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/xhsong/).

My research interests focus on the broad areas of multimodal learning, AI agent, efficient learning, and scene understanding. Recently, I focus on
- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM)
- MLLM-based Agent
- MLLM-based Multimodal Retrieval
- Dataset Distillation
